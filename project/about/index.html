As a selectively mute child most of my youth, I found writing and art to be the easiest ways to express myself. (And the high I got from praise when it felt like I could do nothing else "right" encouraged continuity.)</p><p>Writing professionally since 2006, I've dabbled in several different creative ventures following my time serving as Vice President of a small company.</p><p>I started freelancing in college as a ghostwriter. And after two of my children were born, I fell for the (fictitious) "security" of a multi-level marketing scam before it lead to discovering a passion for graphic design. During that brief stint, I fell for web design and online strategizing as most of my clients presented the need for full services and not simply "fresh graphics". My desire to help others problem-solve and grow became evident.</p><p>Working with design clients unveiled that many small business owners struggle to market and grow their businesses, especially on tight budgets. Impassioned, and through rigorous trial and error, I designed strategic courses for entrepreneurs, and still offer a <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/null/undefined" title="https://amzn.to/4eD3z9h" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business and content planner</a> which one loyal customer called a "business coach in your bag". </p><h4>But in 2013, shortly after my youngest was born, my ability to maintain the appearance of a "normal" life became unmanageable.</h4><p>Sure, having three (young) kids when I planned to have none factored, but that proved to only be a fraction of the struggle.</p><p>In addition to a mental health decline, I grew sicker, larger, and less and less able to walk due to chronic, debilitating abdominal pain.</p><p>At the time, I found myself migrating away from business writing, leaning more on personal writing to process what was happening to me.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--right"><img loading="lazy" src="https://segwrites.com/media/posts/3/Bullet-Journal-Image.png" alt="Image of Sara Eatherton-Goff's bullet journal (2017)" width="400" height="396" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 88vw" srcset="https://segwrites.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-xs.png 640w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-sm.png 768w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-md.png 1024w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-lg.png 1366w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-xl.png 1600w"></figure><p>It started as bullet journaling — “a method of personal organization... using bullet points and symbols to organize tasks, events, goals, and inspirations into a single notebook” — and writing short daily summaries following weekly task-management spreads. And although I enjoyed the tactile process (and doodling again), it wasn’t enough. Organically, the daily summaries snowballed into longer-form, handwritten journal entries.</p><p><strong>Then, one day, it hit me: <em>I have no idea what my body’s doing. Countless doctors have no idea what's going on with me. I can’t be the only person who’s ever had a health problem that wasn’t easily solved. I should document and share this.</em></strong></p><figure class="post__image post__image--left"><img loading="lazy" src="https://segwrites.com/media/posts/3/Bullet-Journal-Image-journal-2.png" alt="" width="3071" height="2325" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 88vw" srcset="https://segwrites.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-journal-2-xs.png 640w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-journal-2-sm.png 768w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-journal-2-md.png 1024w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-journal-2-lg.png 1366w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-journal-2-xl.png 1600w"></figure>I began writing <a href="https://segwrites.medium.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Medium</a>, sharing emotionally charged fragments of my experience, memories and more. It was cathartic. And for what felt like the first time in my conscious life, people listened to and engaged with me. I felt <em>valuable, </em>and like I was contributing something meaningful to society. And that felt more rewarding than any positive feedback given on my design portfolio, products, professional projects or business articles, or any form of ghostwriting ever did.<p></p><blockquote><h6>Intimate, personal writing and advocacy have given me the opportunity to help more people in a way that adds joy and hope into my own life, too.</h6></blockquote><h2>The Diagnostic Journey</h2><p>By the time a gastroenterologist finally diagnosed the severe abdominal pain as Celiac Disease a couple of years later, I’d already turned my coaching business into an automated email course series. (One of my 2025 projects is to revive this in a standalone resource website for entrepreneurs.) I stopped seeing clients and reduced my available products down to the one planner for professionals. And, excitingly, I had almost 1,000 regular Medium readers of my personal essays and short stories within a little over a year of writing there.</p><p>Upon the Celiac diagnosis, I immediately cut gluten out of my diet. I went from unable to stand for more than a few minutes at a time to zipping around the house, tackling projects I only dreamed of getting to <em>"if I made it out alive". </em>I lost just shy of 100 pounds (ca. 45 kg) in a year, yet additional health issues lingered and worsened as time progressed.</p><h4>As far back as I can remember, I’ve been hyper-sensitive to sunlight and heat, but my reactions became so severe, I had to remain indoors at all times.</h4><p>Outside even in the shade, my skin would flush, grow hives, bubble and blister. I've likened the feeling to trying to "hug a bonfire" or trying to "make out with a flat-top grill".</p><p>Even gluten-free foods began causing my skin and other systems to overreact. I’d get severe stomach cramps, gut pain that felt like fireworks exploding inside me, gastrointestinal issues, brain fog, fatigue, joint pain and stiffness, and tachycardia or palpitations. And in some cases: dyspnea. And, although mobile again, I still found myself stuck inside for 99% of the year, thinking that’s just how life would be for me from then on.</p><p>As a nature-loving person, that felt like a prison sentence.</p><p>However, after evacuating our home ahead of Hurricane Irma’s landfall in 2017, we noticed that the further from Florida (really, from the Equator and likely humidity) I got, the more I could be outside, in direct sunlight with minimal issue — or, now, with medications, extra skin protection, cooling aparatuses, and with histamine-avoidant dietary support, I started to experience fewer and often lesser sun- and heat-induced issues.</p><p>Feeling hopeful, when we returned home just shy of a week and a half later, we took steps to leave the state for good.</p><p>After about a month of researching, we decided to vet Seattle as it had the second (behind the significantly more expensive San Francisco) safest year-round climate in the U.S, plus, it could support my dietary dining-out desires and healthcare needs, as well.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--right"><img loading="lazy" src="https://segwrites.com/media/posts/3/Family-Seattle-Center.png" alt="" width="3071" height="2325" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 88vw" srcset="https://segwrites.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Family-Seattle-Center-xs.png 640w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Family-Seattle-Center-sm.png 768w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Family-Seattle-Center-md.png 1024w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Family-Seattle-Center-lg.png 1366w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/3/responsive/Family-Seattle-Center-xl.png 1600w"></figure><p>Fast-forward to mid-2018, our house sold and we officially made the cross-country move to Seattle.</p><p>Our first apartment was a third-floor walk-up. At first I thought I was just out of shape, but the more I did it, the harder getting up to the apartment became. I started having plantar fascia and Achilles tendon issues, knee and hip problems, post-stair tachycardia, and it began to feel like my body was on the verge of anaphylactic reactions. Before our lease was up, we left that apartment, opting for a place with air conditioning and elevators. But by late 2019, after a system-triggering attempt to go vegan, my body's multi-system reactivity exploded.</p><p>Over-75-degree days had me stuck indoors with air conditioning blasting all over again — although thankfully that ends up being just several collective days of a Seattle summer, unlike in Florida where at least 50 out of 52 weeks left me unable to be outside for longer than a couple of minutes.</p><p>I couldn’t breathe well, stairs became entirely out of the quetion, and I was unable to eat more than a dozen total foods. Everything had to be cooked well, and only very fresh meats or previously frozen vegetables. My body resumed the “survival mode” which likely kept me alive for almost 30 years with the undiagnosed, severely symptomatic Celiac, and I started packing on weight again.</p><p>Then, the COVID-19 pandemic took over everyone’s lives in early 2020.</p><p>Then came the privileged, albeit all-consuming and stressful time of co-teaching my three young kids in online school for the next two(-plus) years. And, as you probably can guess, my health took a further nosedive.</p><h4>After the past several years of health decline, my symptoms are finally at a more manageable level, even with some symptoms becoming degenerative.</h4><p>And after a "health hiatus" in 2024, I took time to learn how to better cope with chronic illness, and learned so much about myself, my conditions, and about my family. I've collected what I hope are the last of mh diagnoses that, being acknowledged, accommodated, and — where able — managed, I'm finally living the best life I can. And I'm writing about it all in personal narratives while also exploring life through "what if" fictionalized scenarios.</p><p>For the fellow chronic illness sufferers or the curious, I've been officially diagnosed with (in order):</p><ul><li>Anxiety</li><li>Celiac Disease</li><li>ADHD</li><li>Autism (ASC – Autism Spectrum Condition; formerly diagnosed with Bipolar II Disorder, Major Depressive Disorder and Borderline Personality Disorder, which are common Autism-in-women misdiagnoses)</li><li>c-PTSD</li><li>Mast Cell Activation Syndrome (MCAS)</li><li>Asthma</li><li>Hypermobile Ehlers-Danlos Syndrome (hEDS)</li><li>Thoracic Outlet Syndrome</li><li>Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome (PoTS) / Chronic Orthostatic Intolerance (COI)</li><li>Labile Hypothyroidism (system dysregulated)</li><li>Labile Hypertension (when triggered repeatedly)</li></ul><div class="newsletter-box"><h2 class="align-center">Get new stories directly in your inbox</h2><p class="align-center">Sign up to receive infrequent musings, the latest fiction and non-fiction narratives, updates, and "life nuggets".</p><p class="align-center"><strong><a href="https://world.hey.com/segwrites" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sign up ➔</a></strong></p><p class="align-center" style="margin-top: 40px; font-size: 12px;"><em>Safe, shame-free unsubscribe at any time.</em></p></div><h2>My Favorite Pieces (so far)</h2><p><strong>But You Don't Look Autistic </strong>(2022), essay, <a href="https://medium.com/invisible-illness/but-you-dont-look-autistic-8a96f8198d51" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Invisible Illness</em></a></p><p><strong>fitting in at what cost?</strong> (2021), essay, <em><a href="https://world.hey.com/segwrites/fitting-in-at-what-cost-e6cf649f" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hey, World!</a></em></p><p><strong>then it was</strong> <strong>over</strong> (2021), short narrative essay, <em><a href="https://world.hey.com/segwrites/then-it-was-over-f3795c32" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hey, World!</a></em></p><p><strong><em>Better</em></strong><em> </em>(2017), short story, <a href="https://segwrites.medium.com/max-story-start-from-novel-better-77edfcbdf420" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Medium</em></a></p><p><em><strong>It's All Immaterial</strong></em><em> </em>(2017), short story, <em><a href="https://segwrites.medium.com/its-all-immaterial-5af9ee57dc7f" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium</a></em></p><p><strong>That's a Twenty Well Spent</strong> (2017), personal essay, <em><a href="https://medium.com/the-ascent/twenty-dollars-ab29bf8de614" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ascent Publication</a></em></p></div><footer class="content__footer"><div class="content__inner"><div class="content__actions"></div></div></footer></div></article></main><footer class="section section--light footer" id="footer"><div class="footer__bottom"><div class="wrapper grid gap-8 sm:gap-10 lg:gap-24 sm:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-4"><div class="footer__item"><a class="footer__logo" href="https://segwrites.com/"><img src="https://segwrites.com/media/website/segwrites-logo-wb.png" alt="segwrites" width="1140" height="341"></a><div class="footer__copyright"><p><strong><a href="https://world.hey.com/segwrites" target="_blank" style="font-family: var(--font-base); font-size: inherit; border-bottom: 3px solid rgba(var(--yellow), 1); background: rgba(var(--yellow), 0.2);" rel="noopener">Subscribe to Free Newsletter</a></strong></p><p><a href="https://amzn.to/3ENAVlL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Get Planner</a></p><p><a href="/project/stories">Read Stories</a></p><p><a href="/about">About</a></p><p><a href="https://segwrites.com">Home</a></p><p>© 2024 Sara Eatherton-Goff  |  All rights reserved.</p></div></div><div class="footer__item"><h3 class="footer__heading">Connect</h3><p><a href="mailto:sara@segwrites.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sara[at]segwrites.com</a></p><p><a href="https://segwrites.medium.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Medium</a></p><p><a href="https://www.pinterest.com/segwrites/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pinterest</a></p></div></div></div></footer><script defer="defer" src="https://segwrites.com/assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=36b3c7cb6098fc2e7975eb88db858fed"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
