As someone who loves solving problems, I experimented with web design and discovered a passion for developing online growth strategies. I found that most clients needed more than just graphics; they required a full range of services.</p><p data-block-id="6dcb7f79-7886-49c8-bac2-14d53d3b30ad">With passion and perseverance, I designed strategic courses for entrepreneurs and still offer a <a href="https://amzn.to/3ENAVlL" target="_blank" rel="noopener">business and content planner</a>, which one loyal customer described as a "business coach in your bag".</p><h4 data-block-id="6593d263-0ed2-440e-a2c3-e3daa3d3ad6a">However, in 2013, shortly after my youngest was born, life as I knew it became unmanageable.</h4><p data-block-id="af404171-2e3c-4c76-a376-79a99a921685">Having three young kids when I had planned to have none was a factor, but it was only part of the struggle.</p><p data-block-id="0e02ac0a-aad5-443d-ae11-bcb281e061c1">I experienced a decline in my mental health, and I grew sicker, larger, and less able to walk due to chronic, debilitating abdominal pain.</p><p data-block-id="dce192a9-7da3-41b2-bebf-5cbc98b91ef4">At the time, I shifted away from business writing and focused more on personal narratives to process what was happening to me.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--right"><img loading="lazy" src="https://segwrites.com/media/posts/8/Bullet-Journal-Image-journal.png" alt="[ Image of daily summaries recorded in my bullet journal ]" width="3071" height="2325" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 88vw" srcset="https://segwrites.com/media/posts/8/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-journal-xs.png 640w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/8/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-journal-sm.png 768w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/8/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-journal-md.png 1024w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/8/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-journal-lg.png 1366w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/8/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-journal-xl.png 1600w"></figure><p data-block-id="2a47db98-c025-46be-b469-961d7bcce44c">What started as bullet journaling and writing daily summaries evolved into longer, handwritten journal entries.</p><p data-block-id="97cadd27-274e-48d7-8a98-25abc9fc6330"><strong>Then, one day, it hit me: <em>I have no idea what my body's doing.

But only after another <a href="https://medium.com/@segwrites/surgical-consent-55aa6bd80872" target="_blank" rel="noopener">doctor had unnecessarily performed a total hysterectomy</a>, thinking my pain was caused by a flipped uterus.</p><p data-block-id="cd396f8b-f888-4cf3-b73c-51a9cf75b00c">By then, I had turned my consulting business into an automated email course series.

That felt promising. </p><p data-block-id="3374dcfa-0d09-4684-9618-faf169125261">After the celiac diagnosis, I immediately cut gluten out of my diet. I went from being unable to stand for more than a few minutes to being able to zip around the house. I tackled projects I only dreamed of getting to "if I made it out alive." I lost 100 pounds in a year, but more health issues emerged and worsened over time.</p><h4 data-block-id="acab689f-6928-424a-a556-a2ab609025f5">As far back as I can remember, I've been hypersensitive to sunlight and heat, but my reactions became so severe that I had to remain indoors at all times.</h4><p data-block-id="acab689f-6928-424a-a556-a2ab609025f5">Even in the shade, my skin would flush, grow hives, bubble, and blister. I've likened the feeling to trying to "hug a bonfire" or trying to "make out with a flat-top grill."</p><p data-block-id="c04821ba-f8db-4514-ba00-bc27c115fc90">Even gluten-free foods began causing my skin and other systems to overreact. I'd get severe stomach cramps and gut pain like fireworks exploding inside me. I had gastrointestinal issues, brain fog, fatigue, joint pain, and a racing heart. And with some foods and exposures, like heat, I experience dyspnea. Although I was mobile again, I still found myself stuck inside for most of the year, thinking that's how life would be from then on.</p><p data-block-id="fdfe19c5-50f5-4fef-9b35-8e76433a57a9">As a nature-loving person, it felt like a prison sentence.</p><p data-block-id="410b8dd3-dc40-497d-9ac7-24c26f78487a">After evacuating our home before Hurricane Irma in 2017, we noticed that the further I got from Florida, the better I could handle the sun. The lower humidity probably helped too. Now, with lots of meds, extra skin protection, a histamine-avoidant diet, and cooling devices, my systemic reactions are better under control. Except for heat, which only seems to get worse with time.</p><p data-block-id="25ff2244-1b3f-42b3-a383-37ec04edd72e">Feeling hopeful, when we returned home a week and a half later, we took steps to leave the state for good. After a month of research, we decided to vet Seattle as a potential new home. It has the second safest-for-me year-round climate in the U.S., behind the more expensive San Francisco. Plus, it could support my dietary and healthcare needs.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--left"><img loading="lazy" src="https://segwrites.com/media/posts/8/Sara-dining-2018-2.png" alt="[ Image of Sara Eatherton-Goff ]" width="3193" height="4148" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 88vw" srcset="https://segwrites.com/media/posts/8/responsive/Sara-dining-2018-2-xs.png 640w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/8/responsive/Sara-dining-2018-2-sm.png 768w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/8/responsive/Sara-dining-2018-2-md.png 1024w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/8/responsive/Sara-dining-2018-2-lg.png 1366w, https://segwrites.com/media/posts/8/responsive/Sara-dining-2018-2-xl.png 1600w"></figure><p data-block-id="22df89ab-b40f-4179-b5e1-fb97b6536517">Fast-forward to mid-2018, our Florida house sold, and we officially made the cross-country move to Seattle.</p><p data-block-id="4ef67baf-cbae-4fd5-955d-067ac25bc507">Our first apartment was a third-floor walk-up. At first, I thought I was out of shape, but as time went on, getting up to the apartment became harder. I developed plantar fasciitis and Achilles tendon issues, knee and hip problems, and post-stair tachycardia. It felt like my body was on the verge of anaphylactic reactions from even minor activity. A couple of months before our lease was up, we left that apartment, opting for a place with air conditioning and elevators. But by late 2019, after a system-triggering attempt to go vegan, my body's multi-system reactivity exploded.</p><p data-block-id="fe92df65-da0b-44fb-81c5-58af48ef5848">Over-75-degree days had me stuck indoors with the A/C blasting. Thankfully, that's only a few days in a Seattle summer. In Florida, I couldn't be outside for more than a couple of minutes for 50 out of 52 weeks of the year.</p><p data-block-id="908ecb29-5daf-41cc-ad04-16de1e2801e3">I couldn't breathe well. Climbing stairs was out of the question. And my body could only eat about a dozen foods. We had to thoroughly cook everything, and my system only tolerated very fresh meats or frozen vegetables. My body resumed "survival mode." It likely kept me alive for almost 30 years with undiagnosed celiac disease. But that meant I was gaining weight again.</p><p data-block-id="0f663261-d256-4871-8b40-b0e6f0524cee">Then, the COVID-19 pandemic took over everyone's lives in early 2020.</p><p data-block-id="e4e1fc79-04fc-40f5-a9c7-3ad92f447ea7">This began a privileged but stressful time of co-teaching my three young kids in online school for the next two-plus years. And, as you may guess, my health took a further nosedive.</p><p data-block-id="e79482b2-e288-433f-ae4b-68fac022482c">After years of declining health, my symptoms are now more manageable.

Along the way, I learned so much about myself, my predicament, and even more about my family.
