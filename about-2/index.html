Being situationally mute throughout most of my youth, I found writing and visual arts to be the easiest ways to communicate and express myself.</p><p>Writing professionally since 2006, I've dabbled in several different creative ventures following my time serving as Vice President of a small company.</p><p>I started freelancing in college as a ghostwriter. And after two of my children were born, I fell for a multi-level marketing scam, but that period revealed my passion for organization and design, which later bred my first independent company, a graphic design business called Goff Designs. During that brief stint, I found enjoyment in the web design process and, later, developing online growth strategies as most of my clients presented the need for full services and not simply the graphic elements I was initially hired for.</p><p>From there, my desire to help others problem-solve and grow beyond the professional realm became evident.</p><p>Working with design clients unveiled that many small business owners struggle to market and grow their businesses, especially when working with tight budgets. Impassioned, and through rigorous trial and error, I designed strategic courses for entrepreneurs, and still offer a <a href="#INTERNAL_LINK#/null/undefined" title="https://amzn.to/4eD3z9h" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">business and content planner</a> which one loyal customer called a "business coach in your bag". </p><h4>But in 2013, shortly after my youngest was born, life as I knew it became unmanageable.</h4><p>Sure, having three (young) kids when I planned to have none factored, but that proved to be only a fraction of the struggle.</p><p>In addition to a mental health decline, I grew sicker, larger, and less and less able to walk due to chronic, debilitating abdominal pain.</p><p>At the time, I found myself migrating away from business writing, leaning more on personal narratives to process what was happening to me.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--right"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///Users/saraeatherton-goff/Documents/Publii/sites/segwrites/input/media/posts/3/Bullet-Journal-Image.png" alt="Image of Sara Eatherton-Goff's bullet journal (2017)" width="400" height="396" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 88vw" srcset="file:///Users/saraeatherton-goff/Documents/Publii/sites/segwrites/input/media/posts/3/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-xs.png 640w, file:///Users/saraeatherton-goff/Documents/Publii/sites/segwrites/input/media/posts/3/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-sm.png 768w, file:///Users/saraeatherton-goff/Documents/Publii/sites/segwrites/input/media/posts/3/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-md.png 1024w, file:///Users/saraeatherton-goff/Documents/Publii/sites/segwrites/input/media/posts/3/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-lg.png 1366w, file:///Users/saraeatherton-goff/Documents/Publii/sites/segwrites/input/media/posts/3/responsive/Bullet-Journal-Image-xl.png 1600w"></figure><p>What started as bullet journaling — “a method of personal organization [...] using bullet points and symbols to organize tasks, events, goals, and inspirations into a single notebook” — and writing short daily summaries following weekly task-management spreads organically snowballed into longer-form, handwritten journal entries. </p><p><strong>Then, one day, it hit me: <em>I have no idea what my body’s doing.

But, only <a href="https://medium.com/@segwrites/surgical-consent-55aa6bd80872" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">after another doctor performed a total hysterectomy unnecessarily</a>, thinking the pain I was feeling was from a flipped uterus.</p><p>By then, I’d already turned my coaching business into an automated email course series.

And, excitingly, I had almost 1,000 regular Medium readers of my personal essays and short stories within a little over a year of writing there.</p><p>Upon the Celiac diagnosis, I immediately cut gluten out of my diet. I went from unable to stand for more than a few minutes at a time to zipping around the house, tackling projects I only dreamed of getting to <em>"if I made it out alive". </em>I lost just shy of 100 pounds (ca. 45 kg) in a year, yet additional health issues lingered and worsened as time progressed.</p><h4>As far back as I can remember, I’ve been hyper-sensitive to sunlight and heat, but my reactions became so severe, I had to remain indoors at all times.</h4><p>Outside, even in the shade, my skin would flush, grow hives, bubble, and blister. I've likened the feeling to trying to "hug a bonfire" or trying to "make out with a flat-top grill".</p><figure class="post__image post__image--right"><img loading="lazy" src="https://segwrites.github.io/segwrites/media/posts/8/Sara-dining-2018.png" alt="Sara Eatherton-Goff, dining, 2018" width="3193" height="4148" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 88vw" srcset="https://segwrites.github.io/segwrites/media/posts/8/responsive/Sara-dining-2018-xs.png 640w, https://segwrites.github.io/segwrites/media/posts/8/responsive/Sara-dining-2018-sm.png 768w, https://segwrites.github.io/segwrites/media/posts/8/responsive/Sara-dining-2018-md.png 1024w, https://segwrites.github.io/segwrites/media/posts/8/responsive/Sara-dining-2018-lg.png 1366w, https://segwrites.github.io/segwrites/media/posts/8/responsive/Sara-dining-2018-xl.png 1600w"></figure><p>Even gluten-free foods began causing my skin and other systems to overreact. I’d get severe stomach cramps, gut pain that felt like fireworks exploding inside me, gastrointestinal issues, brain fog, fatigue, joint pain and stiffness, and tachycardia or palpitations. And with some foods and exposures (like heat): dyspnea. And, although mobile again, I still found myself stuck inside for the majority of the year, thinking that’s just how life would be from then on.</p><p>As a nature-loving person, that felt like a prison sentence.</p><p>However, after evacuating our home ahead of Hurricane Irma’s landfall in 2017, we noticed that the further from Florida (really, from the Equator and likely humidity) I got, the more I could be outside, in direct sunlight with minimal issue — or, now, with medications, extra skin protection, cooling aparatuses, and with a histamine-avoidant diet, I started to experience fewer and often lesser sun- and heat-induced issues.</p><p>Feeling hopeful, when we returned home just shy of a week and a half later, we took steps to leave the state for good.</p><p>After about a month of researching, we decided to vet Seattle as it had the second (behind the significantly more expensive San Francisco) safest year-round climate in the U.S. Plus, it could support my dietary, dining-out desires and healthcare needs too.</p><figure class="post__image post__image--right"><img loading="lazy" src="file:///Users/saraeatherton-goff/Documents/Publii/sites/segwrites/input/media/posts/3/Family-Seattle-Center.png" alt="" width="3071" height="2325" sizes="(min-width: 37.5em) 1600px, 88vw" srcset="file:///Users/saraeatherton-goff/Documents/Publii/sites/segwrites/input/media/posts/3/responsive/Family-Seattle-Center-xs.png 640w, file:///Users/saraeatherton-goff/Documents/Publii/sites/segwrites/input/media/posts/3/responsive/Family-Seattle-Center-sm.png 768w, file:///Users/saraeatherton-goff/Documents/Publii/sites/segwrites/input/media/posts/3/responsive/Family-Seattle-Center-md.png 1024w, file:///Users/saraeatherton-goff/Documents/Publii/sites/segwrites/input/media/posts/3/responsive/Family-Seattle-Center-lg.png 1366w, file:///Users/saraeatherton-goff/Documents/Publii/sites/segwrites/input/media/posts/3/responsive/Family-Seattle-Center-xl.png 1600w"></figure><p>Fast-forward to mid-2018, our Florida house sold and we officially made the cross-country move to Seattle.</p><p>Our first apartment was a third-floor walk-up. At first, I thought I was just out of shape, but as time went on, the harder getting up to the apartment became. I started having plantar fascia and Achilles tendon issues, knee and hip problems, post-stair tachycardia, and it began to feel like my body was on the verge of anaphylactic reactions. A couple of months before our lease was up, we left that apartment, opting for a place with air conditioning and elevators. But by late 2019, after a system-triggering attempt to go vegan, my body's multi-system reactivity exploded.</p><p>Over-75-degree days had me stuck indoors with air conditioning blasting all over again — although thankfully that ends up being just several collective days during a Seattle summer, unlike in Florida where at least 50 out of 52 weeks left me unable to be outside for longer than a couple of minutes.</p><p>I couldn’t breathe well, climbing stairs became entirely out of the question, and my body got to a point where it was unable to eat no more than a dozen total foods. Everything had to be cooked well, and only very fresh meats or previously frozen vegetables could be tolerated. My body resumed the “survival mode” which likely kept me alive for almost 30 years with the undiagnosed, highly symptomatic Celiac, and I started packing on weight again.</p><p>Then, the COVID-19 pandemic took over everyone’s lives in early 2020.</p><p>This began the privileged, albeit all-consuming and stressful time of co-teaching my three young kids in online school for the next two(-plus) years. And, as you may guess, my health took a further nosedive.</p><h4>After the past several years of health decline, my symptoms are finally at a more manageable level, even with some symptoms becoming degenerative.</h4><p>And after taking a "health hiatus" for the bulk of 2024, I took time to learn how to better cope with my chronic illnesses. Along the way, I learned so much about myself, my conditions, and even more about my family. Unlike during the pandemic, I was able to be mindful of my family's and my own needs, and start to build healthier habits around life and work. I've collected what I hope are the last of my diagnoses that, being acknowledged, accommodated, and — where able — managed, I'm finally living the best life I can.
